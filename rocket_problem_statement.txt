Simplified Rocket TDD Challenge
welcome, engineers! your task is to build a rocket simulator using TDD, each stage introduces new requirements. write test first, then write the code to make them pass.
stage 1: basic rocket setup
objective: create a basic rocket and get it ready for launch;
requirements: a rocket has a model (e.g., "explorer-1") and a base_mass (in kg). 2500 kg
fueling: a rocket has a fuel_level ( 0 - 100). it must be at 100 to launch.(is in %)
system check: create a function to verify_readiness(). it should return true  only if the rocket's fuel_level is 100.

stage 2: adding engineers
objective: equip the rocket with an engine that determines it launch capability
requirements:
engine types: a rocket must have an engine. engines add to the rocket's mass and provide lifting power.
alpha engine: adds 5000 kg mass. provides 5000 kg of lift power.
beta engine: adds 10000 kg mass. provides 150000 kg of lift power.
launch mass: a rocket noew has a launch_mass, which is its base_mass plus its engine's mass.
launch sequence: create a function to start_liftoff().
it must first confirm the rocket is ready.
it must then check if the rocket is light enough for the engine to lift.
if all checks pass, it should initiate the launch sequence and update the rocket's status. otherwise, it should indicate a failure.
